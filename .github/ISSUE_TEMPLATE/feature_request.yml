      We would like to implement a feature that displays all cryptocurrency symbols available in our library. This will allow users to easily browse and select the cryptocurrency they are interested in without needing to know the symbol beforehand. The symbols should be displayed in a user-friendly format, possibly including the full name and abbreviation (e.g., Bitcoin (BTC)).
