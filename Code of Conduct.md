# OpenTekHub - Blockchain Project Code of Conduct

## Welcome

Welcome to the Blockchain repository by OpenTekHub! This project is part of the **Winter of Blockchain (WoB)** initiative and aims to provide an open-source platform for learning and contributing to blockchain technology. We are committed to maintaining a positive, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone involved.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
